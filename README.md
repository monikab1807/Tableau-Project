### **Overview of the Electric Vehicle (EV) Analysis Tableau Dashboard Project**

The Electric Vehicle (EV) industry has seen significant growth in recent years as governments, consumers, and businesses move towards more sustainable and environmentally-friendly transportation solutions. To assist stakeholders in navigating this rapidly evolving landscape, an interactive Tableau dashboard was developed to offer a comprehensive view of the EV market. This dashboard delivers key insights into industry performance, market trends, and growth projections through dynamic visualizations. With interactive features and detailed analysis, it empowers stakeholders to make data-driven decisions and effectively track the growth of the EV market across regions and time periods.

### **1. Introduction**

The electric vehicle industry is experiencing transformative growth, with an increasing number of consumers adopting electric vehicles (EVs) and governments enforcing policies to accelerate this transition. As the market expands, businesses, investors, and policymakers need real-time data to make informed decisions. This project aimed to create an interactive Tableau dashboard that serves as a tool for analyzing the EV market, focusing on key areas such as sales trends, regional adoption, market share, and the expansion of charging infrastructure. The dashboard is designed to enable stakeholders to explore data, visualize key insights, and make strategic decisions based on the evolving dynamics of the EV industry.

### **2. Dataset**

The dataset for this project was sourced from various reliable and publicly available sources, including industry reports, government data, and market research platforms. The dataset provides detailed information about EV market performance, growth trends, and infrastructure development. Key data points included:
- **Sales Data:** EV sales figures over time, segmented by country and manufacturer.
- **Charging Infrastructure:** Number of EV charging stations worldwide and regional distribution.
- **Market Share:** The distribution of market share among major EV manufacturers and regions.
- **Government Incentives:** Policies and incentives that impact EV adoption, such as subsidies and tax rebates.
- **Consumer Behavior:** Data on consumer preferences and how adoption rates are changing over time.
- **Environmental Impact:** Estimates of reduced CO2 emissions based on the growing number of EVs on the road.

### **3. Data Cleaning**

Data cleaning was an essential part of preparing the dataset for analysis. The following steps were taken to ensure the quality and accuracy of the data:
- **Handling Missing Data:** Missing values were addressed using imputation methods where possible, or removed from the dataset if they were too sparse to affect overall analysis.
- **Normalization:** Data points across different regions and time periods were normalized to ensure consistency.
- **Outlier Detection:** Outliers were identified and reviewed to determine if they were valid or if they should be excluded from the analysis.
- **Formatting:** Dates were standardized, and categorical variables (such as vehicle types or regions) were consistently labeled to avoid inconsistencies in the dashboard.

### **6. Visualizations**

The dashboard integrates several visualization types to present data in a user-friendly and interactive manner, enabling stakeholders to easily analyze and interpret trends in the EV market. Key visualizations include:

- **Donut Chart:**
  The donut chart is used to show the market share distribution of electric vehicle manufacturers in different regions. This provides a clear, visually engaging representation of how the market is segmented among various players.

- **Area Chart:**
  The area chart is used to visualize the growth of EV sales over time. It shows how the market has expanded year-over-year, with different regions or manufacturers represented as stacked areas. This makes it easy to see the cumulative growth and compare different data points over time.

- **Map Chart:**
  A map chart is used to show the geographic distribution of electric vehicle adoption and charging stations. Regions with the highest adoption rates are highlighted, allowing users to identify patterns in regional EV market growth and infrastructure.

- **Horizontal Bar Chart:**
  The horizontal bar chart is used to display comparisons between total vehicles and model, making it easy to rank different entities in terms of sales volume, market share, or charging station availability.

- **Table:**
  The table provides detailed numerical data such as total EV vehicles by model, make, and EV type. This allows users to view exact figures and compare values side by side for specific time periods or geographic locations.
